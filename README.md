# Visual Question Answering (VQA) with Self-Supervised Learning

## Overview

This project implements a Visual Question Answering (VQA) system using self-supervised learning techniques for few-shot learning. The system pretrains a convolutional neural network (CNN) on self-supervised tasks and fine-tunes it on a VQA dataset.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VQA.git
   cd VQA
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prepare the dataset:**

   - Place your images in the `data/images/` directory.
   - Create a `dataset.json` file in the `data/` directory with the following format:

     ```json
     [
         {
             "image_path": "images/image1.jpg",
             "question": "What is in the image?",
             "answer": 1
         },
         {
             "image_path": "images/image2.jpg",
             "question": "How many objects are there?",
             "answer": 3
         },
         ...
     ]
     ```

## Usage

### Pretraining

Pretrain the CNN model on self-supervised tasks:

```bash
python src/pretrain.py
```

### Fine-tuning

Fine-tune the pretrained model on the VQA dataset:

```bash
python src/tune.py
```

### Evaluation

Evaluate the fine-tuned model:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```

### Running the Entire Process

Run the entire process (pretraining, fine-tuning, and evaluation) using the main script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Model and Dataset Details

- **VQAModel**: The model architecture used for VQA.
- **VQADataset**: The custom dataset class for loading VQA data.
- **Self-Supervised Tasks**: Tasks used to pretrain the CNN model.

## Notes

- Ensure the paths in `dataset.json` are correct relative to the `data/` directory.
- Modify the `VQAModel` and `VQADataset` classes as needed to suit your specific dataset and model architecture.
